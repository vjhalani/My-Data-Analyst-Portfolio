[Visuals](https://github.com/vjhalani/My-Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Telecom_Customer_Churn.ipynb)<br/>
<br/>
   **Description**:</br> AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other 
   competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the 
   managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate ‚ÄúBusiness and Data Intelligence‚Äù to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data 
   analytics team to provide them with these insights.</br>
   Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.<br/>
   <br/>
   **Technology**:</br> PowerBi, Tableau<br/>
   <br/>
   **Learning from this project:**</br> I learned how to create a custom Calendar visual using a matrix table in Power BI, which can be applied for various types of analysis.</br>
                                 I also learned how to make use of bookmarks and selections for different purposes. This helped me implement features like page navigation and a clear                                    filter button in the dashboard, similar to how you find on websites like YouTube. (You can watch tutorials on page navigation on YouTube.)</br>
                                 Additionally, I experimented with color palettes and maintained consistent colors throughout the dashboard. You can find a suitable color palette using                                  the provided link.<br/>
  <br/>
   **Insights**:</br>   Mumbai generates the highest revenue (669 M) followed by Bangalore, Hyderabad and Delhi</br>
               AtliQ Exotica performs better compared to all 7 type of properties with 320 Million revenue, rating 3.62, occupancy percentage 57 and cancellation rate as 24.4%.</br>
               AtliQ Bay has the highest occupancy of 66%</br>
               Week 24 recorded the highest revenue among all, which is 139.6 Million</br>
               Delhi tops both in occupancy and rating followed by Hyderabad, Mumbai, Bangalore</br>
               AtliQ lost around 298 Million in cancellation</br>
               Elite type rooms has the most booking and as well higher cancellation rateBy researching the cancellation policies of different hotels, I discovered that most hotels                    don't charge a cancellation fee if you cancel your booking more than three months before the check-in date. However, if you cancel after that point, the fees typically                  range from 60% to 90% of the total booking cost.</br>
